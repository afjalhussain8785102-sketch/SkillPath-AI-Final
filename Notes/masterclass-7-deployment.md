# 🚀 Masterclass 7: From Code to Cloud
### Deployment — Render, Vercel, CORS, Cross-Domain Cookies & Going Live
**SkillPath AI — SDG 4: Quality Education**

---

## 📌 Slide 1 — The Final Step

### Where We Are After 6 Masterclasses

After 6 masterclasses, SkillPath AI is a **complete, fully-integrated, production-quality application**:
- ✅ **Frontend (React)** — 14 pages, complete UI, wired to real backend APIs
- ✅ **Backend (Node/Express)** — REST API, JWT auth, all routes and controllers
- ✅ **Database (MongoDB Atlas)** — Already live in the cloud (we connected in MC5!)
- ✅ **AI Integration** — Groq/LLaMA 3.3 70B for roadmaps, chat, lessons, quizzes

**But there's one critical problem:** It only works on YOUR computer. The URL is `http://localhost:5001`. If you close your laptop, the app goes offline. Nobody else can access it.

### The Goal of MC7: Go Live
By the end of this masterclass, SkillPath AI will have a **real URL** that anyone in the world can visit 24/7 — on their phone, on their friend's computer, in another country.

### Three Deployments Needed

1. **MongoDB Atlas** — ✅ Already done in MC5! The database has always been in the cloud.
2. **Backend → Render** — Deploy the Node.js + Express server to Render's cloud platform
3. **Frontend → Vercel** — Deploy the React + Vite app to Vercel's global network

### Real World Restaurant Analogy
You've been cooking in your home kitchen (local development). You have a perfect recipe and the food tastes amazing. Now you're opening a real restaurant (deployment):
- 🏭 The **food warehouse** (MongoDB Atlas) has been running all along — suppliers have always been delivering ingredients
- 👨‍🍳 You need to rent a **commercial kitchen** (Render) with professional equipment where your chefs (Express server) work full-time
- 🏪 You need to open a **storefront** (Vercel) with a proper address where customers can walk in and see your menu (React app) at any time

## 📌 Slide 2 — Understanding the Deployment Architecture

### Before Deployment (Local Development)
```
Your Computer
├── Terminal 1: npm run dev  (React on port 5173)
├── Terminal 2: npm run dev  (Express on port 5001)
└── Both communicate via http://localhost:*
    (Only YOU can access this)
```

### After Deployment (Production)
```
Internet (Global)
├── Vercel Servers (100+ cities worldwide)
│   └── React app → https://skillpath-ai.vercel.app
│
├── Render Servers (United States)
│   └── Express API → https://skillpath-ai-backend.onrender.com
│       └── Connected to MongoDB Atlas (already cloud-hosted)
│
└── Any user, on any device, anywhere in the world can access both
```

### Why Two Different Platforms?

**Vercel** specializes in **frontend/static deployments**:
- Distributes files to 100+ locations globally (CDN — Content Delivery Network)
- Files are served from the nearest location to each user (fast loading)
- Free for static sites and React apps
- One-click GitHub integration

**Render** specializes in **backend server deployments**:
- Runs Node.js processes continuously (not just serving files)
- Manages environment variables, server scaling, and logs
- Free tier available (with a limitation we'll discuss)
- Automatic deployments from GitHub

## 🗳️ ZOOM POLL 1 — Why Two Platforms?
> ⏱️ **Share this poll:** After Slide 2 (Deployment Architecture). Sets up the deployment mental model.

**Question: We deploy the React frontend to Vercel and the Node.js backend to Render. Why don't we deploy both to the same place?**
*(Single Choice)*

A) It's a legal requirement — frontends and backends must be on different servers by law
B) Vercel specializes in static/CDN hosting for frontends; Render specializes in running persistent Node.js server processes — each is optimized for its use case
C) They can't communicate if they're on the same server
D) Deploying to different platforms saves money compared to using one platform for everything

✅ **Correct Answer:** B

> 💬 **Instructor note:** Vercel serves static files from 100+ global CDN locations instantly. Render keeps a Node.js process running 24/7. These are fundamentally different requirements. Using a file host for a server would fail; using a server platform for static files would be wasteful.

---

## 📌 Slide 3 — Preparing the Backend for Deployment

### File: `backend/package.json` — Node Version Specification
Before deploying, we add one important field to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  }
}
```
This tells Render which version of Node.js to use. Without this, Render might use an outdated version that doesn't support modern JavaScript features (like ES Modules, `await` at the top level, etc.).

### Ensure the Port is Dynamic
In `server.js`, the port must come from the environment:
```javascript
// ✅ Correct — reads PORT from environment
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5001;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

**Why?** Render assigns a random port to each service — it's never 5001 in production. Render injects the correct `PORT` via environment variable. If you hardcode `5001`, Render's load balancer can't reach your server and the deployment fails.

### Verify the `start` Script
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js",
  "dev": "nodemon server.js"
}
```
Render uses `npm start` (not `npm run dev`) to launch production servers. Ensure this script exists and runs correctly.

### Step-by-Step: Deploy to Render

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → Sign up with your GitHub account
2. Click **"New +"** → **"Web Service"**
3. Click **"Connect a repository"** → Select your `SDG-Quality-Education` repository
4. Configure the service:
   - **Name:** `skillpath-backend` (or your choice)
   - **Root Directory:** `backend` ← Critical! Tells Render where your backend code lives
   - **Build Command:** `npm install`
   - **Start Command:** `npm start`
   - **Instance Type:** Free (for our purposes)
5. **Add Environment Variables** (the same as your local `.env`):

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `MONGO_URI` | Your MongoDB Atlas connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | A long, random string (generate a new one for production!) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Your Groq API key |
| `CLIENT_URL` | Leave blank for now (add after Vercel deployment) |

6. Click **"Create Web Service"**
7. Watch the build logs — you'll see `npm install` running, then "Server running on port ..."
8. **Copy your Render URL** (e.g., `https://skillpath-backend.onrender.com`)

### Important: Free Tier Behavior
Render's free tier **spins the server down after 15 minutes of inactivity**. The first request after sleeping takes 30–60 seconds to wake up the server. This is completely normal for the free tier — it's not a bug. Paid plans ($7/month) keep the server always awake.

---

## 📌 Slide 4 — Preparing the Frontend for Deployment

### File: `frontend/vercel.json`
This is a critical configuration file that must exist before deploying to Vercel:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
```

### Why This File Exists: The SPA Routing Problem

Vercel hosts static files. When you build the React app with `npm run build`, it generates:
```
frontend/dist/
├── index.html          ← The ONE HTML file for the entire app
├── assets/
│   ├── index-abc123.js ← Compiled JavaScript bundle
│   └── index-abc123.css ← Compiled CSS
```

When a user visits `https://your-app.vercel.app/dashboard`:
- **Without `vercel.json`:** Vercel looks for `dist/dashboard.html` → File doesn't exist → **404 Not Found**
- **With `vercel.json`:** Vercel reads the rewrite rule → Always serves `dist/index.html` → React Router reads `/dashboard` from the URL → Renders `DashboardPage` ✅

The `vercel.json` rule essentially says: **"No matter what URL someone requests, serve `index.html`. Let React Router sort out the rest."**

### File: `frontend/.env.production` (or set on Vercel Dashboard)
```
VITE_API_URL=https://skillpath-backend.onrender.com/api
```

This tells Axios where to send all API requests in production. It must point to your Render backend URL + `/api`.

### Step-by-Step: Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → Sign up with your GitHub account
2. Click **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**
3. Click **"Import"** next to your `SDG-Quality-Education` repository
4. Configure the project:
   - **Framework Preset:** Vite (auto-detected)
   - **Root Directory:** `frontend` ← Critical! Must point to the frontend subfolder
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory:** `dist`
5. **Add Environment Variables:**

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `VITE_API_URL` | `https://skillpath-backend.onrender.com/api` |

6. Click **"Deploy"**
7. Wait for the build (usually 1–2 minutes)
8. **Copy your Vercel URL** (e.g., `https://sdg-quality-education.vercel.app`)

---

---
## 🗳️ ZOOM POLL 2 — The vercel.json Mystery
> ⏱️ **Share this poll:** After Slide 4 (vercel.json). Tests the SPA routing problem understanding.

**Question: A user bookmarks `https://yourapp.vercel.app/roadmap` and visits it later. WITHOUT `vercel.json`, what happens?**
*(Single Choice)*

A) React Router reads the URL and renders the Roadmap page correctly
B) Vercel looks for `dist/roadmap.html` — it doesn't exist — returns a 404 Not Found error
C) The user is automatically redirected to the homepage `/`
D) Vercel prompts the user to log in before accessing the page

✅ **Correct Answer:** B

> 💬 **Instructor note:** The entire React app is in ONE file: `dist/index.html`. Vercel doesn't know that. `vercel.json` tells Vercel: "No matter what URL arrives, serve `index.html` and let React Router figure it out." Without it, every direct URL except `/` returns 404.

---

## 📌 Slide 5 — The CORS Challenge: Connecting Two Different Domains

### Definition
**CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security mechanism that **blocks web pages from making requests to a different domain** than the one they came from — unless the server explicitly allows it.

### The Problem
After deployment:
- Frontend URL: `https://sdg-quality-education.vercel.app`
- Backend URL: `https://skillpath-backend.onrender.com`

These are **different domains**. By default, the browser blocks any request from the Vercel domain to the Render domain, with an error like:
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://skillpath-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/login'
from origin 'https://sdg-quality-education.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy.
```

### Who Enforces CORS?
**The browser** enforces CORS — NOT the server. The server just **declares** which origins are allowed. The browser reads this declaration and decides whether to allow the JavaScript on the page to access the response.

This is why CORS only affects browser JavaScript. A server making direct HTTP requests to another server (curl, Postman, Thunder Client) is never blocked by CORS.

### The Fix in `backend/server.js`
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: function(origin, callback) {
    // Strip trailing slashes (a common gotcha!)
    const normalize = (url) => url?.replace(/\/$/, '');

    const allowedOrigins = [
      normalize(process.env.CLIENT_URL),
      'http://localhost:5173',   // Local development
      'http://localhost:3000',   // Alternative local port
    ].filter(Boolean);           // Remove any empty values

    const requestOrigin = normalize(origin);

    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(requestOrigin)) {
      callback(null, true);   // ✅ Allow this request
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS policy'));
    }
  },
  credentials: true,   // ESSENTIAL for cookies to work cross-origin
}));
```

### Update `CLIENT_URL` on Render
Now that you have the Vercel URL, go back to Render → Your service → Environment:
- `CLIENT_URL` → `https://sdg-quality-education.vercel.app` ← No trailing slash!

After saving, Render automatically redeploys the service with the new environment variable.

### The Trailing Slash Problem: A Real Production Bug
`https://skillpath.vercel.app` ≠ `https://skillpath.vercel.app/`

These look identical to humans but are technically different strings. If your `CLIENT_URL` has a trailing slash and the browser sends the origin without one (or vice versa), CORS silently fails — every API call is blocked. Our `normalize()` function strips trailing slashes before comparing.

---

---
## 🗳️ ZOOM POLL 3 — CORS Enforcement
> ⏱️ **Share this poll:** After Slide 5 (CORS section). Addresses the most common misconception about CORS.

**Question: You get a CORS error in the browser when the frontend calls the backend. Your friend opens the same API URL in Postman and it works perfectly. Why?**
*(Single Choice)*

A) Postman uses a different port that is whitelisted in CORS
B) CORS is enforced by the BROWSER, not the server — Postman and curl bypass it because they're not browsers
C) The API key is automatically included in Postman requests but not browser requests
D) Postman caches the CORS approval from a previous successful request

✅ **Correct Answer:** B

> 💬 **Instructor note:** This is the key CORS insight. The server just declares which origins are allowed. The BROWSER reads that declaration and decides whether to let JavaScript access the response. Tools like Postman, curl, and server-to-server calls are never subject to CORS — it's purely a browser security feature.

---

## 📌 Slide 6 — The Cross-Domain Cookie Problem

### Why Cookies are Harder in Production
In local development, both the frontend (`localhost:5173`) and backend (`localhost:5001`) are on the same `localhost` domain. Cookies set by `localhost:5001` are automatically sent with requests to `localhost:5001`.

In production:
- Frontend: `sdg-quality-education.vercel.app` (Vercel's domain)
- Backend: `skillpath-backend.onrender.com` (Render's domain)

These are **completely different domains**. By default, browsers do NOT send cookies across different domains (this is the Same-Site cookie policy).

### The Solution: Three Settings Must ALL Be True

For cross-domain cookies to work, THREE conditions must all be met simultaneously:

| Setting | Where | Why It's Needed |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| `withCredentials: true` | Frontend Axios | Tells browser to send/accept cookies cross-origin |
| `sameSite: 'none'` | Backend cookie | Explicitly allows the cookie to be sent cross-site |
| `secure: true` | Backend cookie | Required by ALL browsers when `sameSite: 'none'` is set (cookies must be HTTPS-only) |

All three must be configured. If any one is missing, authentication breaks in production.

### The Cookie Configuration in `backend/utils/generateToken.js`
```javascript
export const generateToken = (res, userId) => {
  const token = jwt.sign({ userId }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '30d' });

  res.cookie('jwt', token, {
    httpOnly: true,   // JS cannot read this cookie (XSS protection)
    
    // In PRODUCTION: secure: true + sameSite: 'none' enables cross-domain cookies
    // In DEVELOPMENT: secure: false + sameSite: 'strict' (same domain, no HTTPS needed)
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    sameSite: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'none' : 'strict',
    
    maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,  // 30 days
  });
};
```

### Debugging Cross-Domain Cookie Issues
If after deployment, login appears to succeed but then every page shows the user as logged out:
1. Open Chrome DevTools → Application → Cookies
2. Check if the `jwt` cookie exists after login
3. If it exists but gets ignored: check that Axios has `withCredentials: true`
4. If it doesn't exist: check that `secure: true` and `sameSite: 'none'` are set in the backend
5. Check that the backend is HTTPS (Render provides HTTPS by default on `.onrender.com` URLs)

---

---
## 🗳️ ZOOM POLL 4 — Cross-Domain Cookies
> ⏱️ **Share this poll:** After Slide 6 (Cross-Domain Cookie Problem). The trickiest production config check.

**Question: After deploying, login appears to work but every page refresh shows the user as logged out. The JWT cookie exists in DevTools but is being ignored. Which setting is most likely the culprit?**
*(Single Choice)*

A) The `JWT_SECRET` on Render is different from the one used during development
B) Axios is missing `withCredentials: true` — so the browser never sends the cookie with API requests
C) The `VITE_API_URL` points to the wrong Render URL
D) MongoDB Atlas is not allowing connections from Render's IP address

✅ **Correct Answer:** B

> 💬 **Instructor note:** Without `withCredentials: true`, Axios never sends cookies cross-domain — even if the cookie exists in the browser. Check DevTools → Network → any API request → Request Headers → look for the `Cookie` header. If it's missing, `withCredentials` is the issue.

---

## 📌 Slide 7 — Environment Variables: Local vs Production

### The Environment Variable Map

| Variable | Local (`.env`) | Render (backend) | Vercel (frontend) |
|----------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | `production` | — |
| `MONGO_URI` | Your Atlas URI | Same Atlas URI | — |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Any string | New long random string | — |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Your key | Same key | — |
| `CLIENT_URL` | `http://localhost:5173` | `https://your-app.vercel.app` | — |
| `VITE_API_URL` | `http://localhost:5001/api` | — | `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api` |

### Security Upgrade for Production
When deploying to production, generate a **new, stronger JWT_SECRET**:
```bash
# Run in Node.js REPL:
require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex')
# Generates a 128-character hex string — much stronger than any manual secret
```

Use this new secret in Render. Your old development tokens will be instantly invalidated (which is good — no development tokens can be used in production).

### Why `.env` Files Are Never Committed to Git
```
Your local .env file contains:
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://ankush:MyActualPassword@cluster0.mongodb.net/skillpath
JWT_SECRET=MyDevelopmentSecret
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_RealApiKeyHere123

If this is committed to GitHub:
→ Anyone who searches GitHub can find it
→ They can connect directly to YOUR MongoDB database
→ They can delete all user data, extract emails, crash the service
→ Groq bills YOUR credit card for their API usage
→ They can forge JWT tokens for any user account
```

The `.gitignore` file contains `.env` so it's NEVER accidentally committed.

## 📌 Slide 8 — MongoDB Atlas: Production Database Configuration

### What Was Already Set Up in MC5
- Cluster created on MongoDB Atlas
- Database user created with read/write permissions
- IP whitelist: your local IP was added during development

### What Needs to Change for Production

**Step 1: Allow Render's IP Addresses**
Render's servers use dynamic IP addresses — they change. The easiest solution for development/student projects:
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas → Security → Network Access
2. Click "Add IP Address"
3. Click "Allow Access from Anywhere" → This adds `0.0.0.0/0`
4. Click Confirm

⚠️ **Security note:** `0.0.0.0/0` allows connections from any IP. For production projects with real users, you would whitelist only Render's specific IP ranges. For our student project, this is acceptable.

**Step 2: Verify the Connection String Format**
Your `MONGO_URI` should look like:
```
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/skillpath?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
- Replace `username` and `password` with your Atlas database user credentials
- Replace `cluster0.abc123` with your actual cluster hostname
- Replace `skillpath` with your database name

## 🎮 Two Truths and One Lie — MC7

---

### 🔴 Round 1 — About CORS and the Browser

- 🟢 CORS is enforced by the browser — the browser reads the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header from the server and decides whether to let the page's JavaScript access the response.
- 🟢 Without `vercel.json`, any URL on the Vercel deployment except `/` returns a 404 — because Vercel looks for a corresponding HTML file in `/dist` that doesn't exist.
- 🔴 CORS affects ALL types of HTTP requests — including requests made from tools like Postman, Thunder Client, or `curl` on the command line.

> **🎯 The Lie:** CORS is a **browser-only** security mechanism. Postman, Thunder Client, curl, and any server-to-server requests are never blocked by CORS because CORS is enforced by the browser, not the server. Only browsers making cross-origin requests check CORS policies.

---

### 🔴 Round 2 — About Cross-Domain Cookies

- 🟢 For cross-domain cookies to work in production, THREE things must all be true simultaneously: `withCredentials: true` on Axios, `sameSite: 'none'` on the cookie, and `secure: true` on the cookie.
- 🟢 The `secure: true` cookie flag means the cookie will ONLY be sent over HTTPS connections — never over plain HTTP.
- 🔴 The `httpOnly: true` cookie flag prevents the cookie from being sent to cross-domain servers — that's why it's needed for CORS.

> **🎯 The Lie:** `httpOnly: true` prevents **JavaScript on the page from reading** the cookie — it has nothing to do with cross-domain behavior. The cross-domain behavior is controlled by `sameSite` and `secure`. `httpOnly` protects against XSS attacks (malicious scripts can't steal the token), but it doesn't restrict which servers the cookie is sent to.

---

### 🔴 Round 3 — About Vite and Deployment

- 🟢 Vite environment variables (like `VITE_API_URL`) are baked into the JavaScript bundle at build time — changing them on Vercel requires triggering a new build.
- 🟢 Render's free tier spins the server down after 15 minutes of inactivity — the first request after sleep can take 30–60 seconds to respond.
- 🔴 Because MongoDB Atlas is already on the cloud, it doesn't need any configuration changes to work with a Render backend — it will automatically accept connections from Render's servers.

> **🎯 The Lie:** MongoDB Atlas's default configuration only allows connections from specific, whitelisted IP addresses. Render uses dynamic (changing) IP addresses, so you must either whitelist all IPs (`0.0.0.0/0`) or configure Render's static IP feature (paid plan). Without this network access change, Render cannot connect to Atlas and the backend crashes on startup.

## 🙋 Mid-Class Questions — MC7

1. **"I've deployed the backend to Render. My frontend is on Vercel. I try to log in on the live site and get a CORS error. Name at least 3 things I should check."**
   *(Expected: 1) Is `CLIENT_URL` on Render set to the exact Vercel URL (no trailing slash)? 2) Is the Render service restarted after adding the env variable? 3) Does `cors()` in server.js use `credentials: true`? 4) Does the Vercel URL use the same origin as what the browser sends? 5) Is `vercel.json` causing any redirect issues?)*

2. **"Without `vercel.json`, what exactly happens when a user bookmarks `https://your-app.vercel.app/roadmap` and visits it later? Walk through exactly what Vercel does."**
   *(Expected: Vercel receives the request for `/roadmap`. It looks in the `dist/` folder for a file called `roadmap.html` or `roadmap/index.html`. No such file exists — only `dist/index.html`. Vercel returns 404. The user sees an error page, not the roadmap. With `vercel.json`, Vercel rewrites ALL paths to `index.html`, and React Router reads the `/roadmap` from the URL and renders the correct page.)*

3. **"The `secure: true` cookie flag means the cookie only works over HTTPS. Our Render backend URL is HTTPS. But during LOCAL development, we use `http://localhost`. Will the app break on localhost?"**
   *(Expected: No — that's why `secure` is conditional: `secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`. In development, `NODE_ENV = 'development'` → `secure: false` → works over HTTP localhost. In production, `NODE_ENV = 'production'` → `secure: true` → requires HTTPS, which Render provides automatically.)*

4. **"You've been using the JWT_SECRET `'mySecret123'` during development. Why should you generate a brand new, stronger secret for production? What would happen if someone found your old dev secret?"**
   *(Expected: The dev secret is likely short and weak — easy to brute-force. More critically: if someone has your JWT_SECRET, they can forge any JWT token. They could create a token with any userId they choose and call any API endpoint as that user — full unauthorized access to everyone's accounts. A 128-character hex string is computationally infeasible to guess.)*

5. **"We've built SkillPath AI over 7 masterclasses. If you had to explain the ENTIRE application — from when a student types their roadmap goal to when they see the roadmap on screen — in under 2 minutes, what would you say?"**
   *(Expected: Allow students to attempt this end-to-end explanation. This is the capstone check — it demonstrates deep understanding of the full stack. Use the 14-step data flow from the previous slide as a reference for what a great answer looks like.)*

### ✅ MC7 Creation Order — Quick Visual Summary

```
CONFIG FILES:
1. frontend/vercel.json        ← SPA rewrite rule (source: /(.*)  dest: /)
2. backend/package.json        ← Add engines.node: >=18.0.0
3. Verify server.js PORT       ← process.env.PORT || 5001

MONGODB ATLAS:
4. Allow 0.0.0.0/0 in Network Access

RENDER DEPLOYMENT:
5. New Web Service → backend/
6. Add all environment variables
7. Copy Render URL

VERCEL DEPLOYMENT:
8. New Project → frontend/
9. Add VITE_API_URL = [Render URL]/api
10. Deploy and copy Vercel URL

CROSS-CONNECT:
11. Set CLIENT_URL on Render = [Vercel URL]
12. Render redeploys automatically

TEST & SHIP:
13. Run full end-to-end test checklist
14. git tag -a v1.0.0 + git push --tags
```

> 💡 **Golden Rule for MC7:** Deploy the **backend first** — you need the Render URL before you can configure the Vercel frontend's `VITE_API_URL`. Then deploy the frontend and use its Vercel URL to update the backend's `CLIENT_URL`. It's a two-step handshake between the two deployments.

## 📌 Slide 15 — Practical Assignment: Implement & Deploy an API Health Dashboard

### 🎯 The Goal
Your assignment is to implement and deploy a public **System Status / API Health Dashboard** (`/status`). This feature will query a backend route that checks database connectivity and returns server uptime. Students will practice coding, testing locally, pushing to Git, deploying, and whitelisting the CORS origin to ensure everything operates seamlessly in production.

### 📚 Concepts You Will Practice
1. **Full-Stack Connection:** Fetch status data from your Express API using Axios.
2. **Production CORS & Whitelisting:** Verify that cross-origin requests function correctly between your live Vercel frontend and Render backend.
3. **Deployment Lifecycle:** Manage the Git workflow (branching, staging, committing, pushing) to trigger automated cloud builds.

---

### 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Create the Backend Endpoint
In `backend/server.js`, add a new health status route. It should check if `mongoose.connection.readyState === 1` and return:
- `{ status: "ok", dbConnected: true, uptime: process.uptime() }`

#### Step 2: Create the Frontend Page Component
Create a new file: `frontend/src/pages/StatusPage.jsx`. Use `useEffect` and `axios` to fetch the status from `[API_URL]/status`. Show a green badge "System Online" if successful, or a red badge "System Offline" if it fails.

#### Step 3: Configure Routing
Register the `/status` route in `frontend/src/App.jsx`. Add a public link to the status page in your footer layout component.

#### Step 4: Deploy and Verify
Commit your changes and push them to GitHub. Wait for Render and Vercel to auto-deploy the updates. Open the status page on your live Vercel URL and check that it successfully queries the live database connectivity status from the Render backend.

### 💻 Example Code Structure

Here is a template to guide your implementation:

```javascript
// Within backend/server.js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

app.get('/api/status', (req, res) => {
  const dbState = mongoose.connection.readyState;
  const states = {
    0: 'disconnected',
    1: 'connected',
    2: 'connecting',
    3: 'disconnecting',
  };

  res.json({
    status: 'ok',
    database: states[dbState] || 'unknown',
    uptime: Math.round(process.uptime()),
    timestamp: new Date()
  });
});
```

```jsx
// File: frontend/src/pages/StatusPage.jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import Navbar from '../components/layout/Navbar';
import Footer from '../components/layout/Footer';
import Badge from '../components/ui/Badge';
import Card from '../components/ui/Card';

function StatusPage() {
  const [status, setStatus] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchStatus = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get(`${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/status`);
        setStatus(response.data);
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Failed to retrieve system status:', err);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };
    fetchStatus();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="app-container">
      <Navbar />
      <main className="status-main">
        <Card className="status-card">
          <h1>System Status 🖥️</h1>
          {loading ? (
            <p>Checking system status...</p>
          ) : status ? (
            <div className="status-details">
              <p>API Status: <Badge variant="success">Online</Badge></p>
              <p>Database: <Badge variant={status.database === 'connected' ? 'success' : 'danger'}>{status.database}</Badge></p>
              <p>Uptime: <strong>{status.uptime} seconds</strong></p>
            </div>
          ) : (
            <div>
              <p>API Status: <Badge variant="danger">Offline</Badge></p>
              <p>Database connection unavailable.</p>
            </div>
          )}
        </Card>
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

export default StatusPage;
```
